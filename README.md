X Y Text File reader/converter

Drag & drop the binary text file into the window (or open it) and the program should interpret & display the text within.

Not much changed from the previous games; program deduces the key from the text (like pptxt) instead of generating it. 

No intent to add editing; generating .txt files (with variables interpreted) and to compare v1.0-v1.2 changes was the goal of the program.
